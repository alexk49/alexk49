👋 Hi, I’m @alexk49

I’m trying to learn to code

I can do some basic python thanks to Jose Portilla, Al Sweigart and others. 

I'm currently working through CS50... 

Otherwise, I am working on my full time job, personal practise projects, codewars and/or project euler. 

As well as 💻, I like ☕ 🦜 🎾 🎸 🎹 🥾 and some other things that can't be expressed with emojis
